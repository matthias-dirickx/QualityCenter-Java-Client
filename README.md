# QualityCenter-Java-Client
Core idea:
Java client to hook up with Quality Center through the REST API to do custom stuff.

Scope of actions: Focus on interaction between tools, especially writing results to test lab.

It is not the goal to have an exhaustive client for the REST API. Instead it is the idea to focus on the use case:
As a test automation engineer
I want to update results in Quality center in the form of runs on a test set for certain interations of the automated tests
In order to have a consolidated view of tests executed over different tools.
